*****Why must we choose you?*****

I when i studied java in class 10 thought of making my carrer in coding field because i love it.I never get bored of doing it.Coding for me is just like what cricket is to a cricketer that is the one thing i would love to do my whole life.I think amfoss will guide me to the path where i can learn more about my passion.I personally feel that seeing this passion of mine amfoss can think of choosing me for the club.I am a bit lazy in doing my work but this is not same when it comes to coding and tech related stuffs.
